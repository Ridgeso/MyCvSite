This is my Django Web Site that I wrote.
I wanted to build a site that would act as my CV, so i included a main page,
an about me page where i put a lot of place to fill with text so anyone can write what they want,
a contact page which saves all the messages into the database
and project page where all my projects are reading from my git hub account.
It should still work even if you change the repository link to someone else's.
Moreover, there are linked my included projects I wrote in JavaScript.
Adding another is simple and requires these few steps:
1. In folder games/templates add folder with your game name
2. In this folder past game.html file
3. Write your game under the comment inside game block
4. At the end, add this project to InnerGameModel, but title must be the same as game folder

You will figure it out ;)
